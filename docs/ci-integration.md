# CI integration

Drive one preview per merge / pull request from CI — no forge webhooks.
GitLab uses the published `preview` component; GitHub uses the reusable
`preview` workflow. Both are thin bootstrappers over `sprout ci preview` /
`sprout ci teardown`: all preview logic lives in the CLI. Each section
below is one task.

- First preview: [Getting started](getting-started.md).
- Manifest keys: [Adopting a repo](adopting-a-repo.md).
- Command flags: [CLI reference](cli-reference.md).

## GitLab component

Wire `.sprout.yaml` at the repo root (see
[Adopting a repo](adopting-a-repo.md)), two required masked CI variables
(plus optional `GITLAB_TOKEN` for MR notes), and one include. No adopter
shell scripts:

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml
include:
  - component: $CI_SERVER_FQDN/<group>/sprout-ci/preview@v0.9.0
    inputs: { stage: deploy }
```

Replace `<group>/sprout-ci` with the component project path on the
instance and `v0.9.0` with the adopted sprout release. Where the component
project is unavailable, use the `include: remote` fallback documented in
[`templates/README.md`](../templates/README.md) (remote includes must set
`sprout_version` explicitly to the tag in the URL).

What the three jobs do:

- `sprout-preview` (merge-request pipelines only): installs the pinned,
  checksum-verified `sprout` binary (version = component version), builds +
  pushes the app image (`CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:<SHA>`) and — when `.sprout.yaml`
  sets `seed` — the seed image (commit-scoped `<SHA>-seed` tag rebuilt on
  every run, or — with explicit `seed.inputs` — a `seed-<shorthash>` tag
  content-addressed over those inputs, where an authenticated
  `docker manifest inspect` skips the build + push when that tag already
  exists and logs `seed image reused: <ref>`), deploys, writes `PREVIEW_URL=`
  to the `sprout-preview.env` dotenv artifact that feeds `environment:url`,
  and best-effort posts/updates the MR note with the preview URL (forge
  failures only warn with the forge's error body, never the token). The URL
  comes from the CLI's output only — never reconstruct the hostname in CI.
- `sprout-stop-preview` (`on_stop`, Stop button / MR close / merge /
  `auto_stop_in` expiry): `sprout ci teardown` (idempotent — exit 0 when
  already gone).
- `sprout-reset` (manual, instant): `sprout ci reset` — wipe the preview
  database and redeploy + seed from scratch (data wiped). Press **Run** on it
  inside the MR pipeline for the reset *now* (GitLab has no
  description-edit → pipeline trigger, and a fresh "Run pipeline" arrives as
  `CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE=web`, which `sprout ci` refuses — so the instant path
  lives inside the existing MR pipeline).
- Prerequisites owned by the component: dind service, registry login,
  `apk` packages. Adopters declare no packages and no Docker setup.

Prerequisites on the GitLab side: merge-request pipelines
(`CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE=merge_request_event`; branch pipelines are refused
with a named error) and a runner that can run privileged `docker:dind`.
The operator must have deployed the [operator compose stack](operator-deploy.md)
and minted the deploy token. Pull credentials on the gateway follow the
deploy `app_image` host (`SPROUT_REGISTRY_AUTHS_JSON` per host, empty =
anonymous).

### Component → CLI ownership

The component YAML above calls exactly three `sprout ci` subcommands —
everything else is manual (run from a merge-request pipeline or laptop).
Flag details live in [CLI reference](cli-reference.md#ci-commands).

| Component job | CLI call | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| `sprout-preview` | `sprout ci preview --tail … --dotenv-file … [--app-env-file …] [--seed-env-file …] [--reseed]` | Builds + pushes the app image and — when `.sprout.yaml` sets `seed` — the seed image (always rebuilt, unless explicit `seed.inputs` opt into content-addressed reuse: an existing tag skips the rebuild, reuse is logged, a failed check rebuilds), deploys (with `--reseed` when the flag is passed), writes `PREVIEW_URL=` to the dotenv artifact, dumps the gateway log tail on failure, and posts/updates the MR note (best-effort). |
| `sprout-stop-preview` | `sprout ci teardown` (no flags) | Idempotent teardown; rewrites the MR note in place ("preview was removed"). No Docker daemon, no registry login on this path. |
| `sprout-reset` | `sprout ci reset --tail … --dotenv-file … [--app-env-file …] [--seed-env-file …]` | Wipe the preview database and redeploy + seed from scratch (data wiped). No rebuild: reuses the already pushed images for the commit, so no Docker daemon and no registry login on this path. |

Manual helpers (never called by the component): `sprout ci reseed -s …`
(re-run the seed against the existing database) and `sprout ci logs
[--tail N]` (container logs through the gateway).

### Component inputs (`templates/preview.yml`)

Set these inputs on the include. Full prose reference:
[`templates/README.md`](../templates/README.md). Contract tests:
`templates/preview.test.ts` (inputs are exactly this set — no Dockerfile
guards, no extra-args hatch; self-contained, no `spec:include`, no global
keywords). There are no service-related component inputs — companions go
through `sprout ci preview --service`.

| Input | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `sprout_version` | release tag shipping the file (sentinel replaced at publish) | CLI release to install (checksum-verified). Override to pin or trial another build. Remote includes must set it explicitly to the tag in the URL. |
| `stage` | `deploy` | Stage for all three jobs. |
| `sprout_url` | `""` (use `$SPROUT_URL`) | Gateway URL override. |
| `app_context` | `.` | Directory holding `.sprout.yaml`; the CLI builds (`docker build … .`) and resolves Dockerfiles relative to it. |
| `auto_stop_in` | `1 week` | `environment:auto_stop_in` for the preview. |
| `app_env_file` | `""` | Project-root-relative extra dotenv file passed as `--app-env-file` (on top of `SPROUT_APP_ENV`). Resolved before `cd` into `app_context`. Repo-relative path only — not a File CI variable. |
| `seed_env_file` | `""` | Project-root-relative extra seed dotenv file passed as `--seed-env-file` (on top of `SPROUT_SEED_ENV`). Same rule. Repo-relative path only — not a File CI variable. |
| `dotenv_file` | `sprout-preview.env` | Project-root-relative dotenv artifact carrying `PREVIEW_URL` to `environment:url`. Parent directories must already exist. |
| `tail` | `200` | Gateway log lines printed when `sprout ci preview` fails. |

### CI variables (GitLab)

| Variable | Type | Masked | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SPROUT_URL` | Variable | yes | Gateway URL (or pass `sprout_url` input instead) |
| `SPROUT_TOKEN` | Variable | yes | Deploy token scoped to the repo's canonical id |
| `SPROUT_APP_ENV` | File | yes | Optional app secrets as one dotenv blob (read automatically by the CLI) |
| `SPROUT_SEED_ENV` | File | yes | Optional seed secrets, same shape |
| `GITLAB_TOKEN` | Variable | yes | Optional MR-note token with note-write. When set, the CLI posts/updates the MR note with it (`PRIVATE-TOKEN`); otherwise it falls back to `CI_JOB_TOKEN` (`JOB-TOKEN`), which can read but not create notes on some instances (401) |

Secrets never appear in job logs, CLI output, or the MR note (the CLI prints
only `preview_url=`).

## GitHub Actions

Add one caller workflow + secrets — parity with the GitLab component. The
**canonical** caller is
[`examples/adopting-repo/.github/workflows/sprout.yml`](../examples/adopting-repo/.github/workflows/sprout.yml)
— copy it rather than pasting fragments from this guide:

```yaml
name: sprout
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed]
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  packages: write
jobs:
  preview:
    uses: simpros/sprout/.github/workflows/preview.yml@v0.9.0
    with:
      sprout_version: v0.9.0
    secrets:
      SPROUT_URL: ${{ secrets.SPROUT_URL }}
      SPROUT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SPROUT_TOKEN }}
      SPROUT_APP_ENV: ${{ secrets.SPROUT_APP_ENV }}
```

What the reusable workflow (`.github/workflows/preview.yml`, a thin
bootstrapper over `sprout ci preview` / `sprout ci teardown`) does:

- Preview on `opened` / `synchronize` / `reopened`: installs the pinned,
  checksum-verified `sprout` binary, builds + pushes images
  (`<registry>/<repo>:<SHA>`, seed image driven by `.sprout.yaml` as on
  GitLab), deploys, and posts/updates the PR comment with the preview URL.
  The URL is also exposed as the `preview_url` output and feeds
  `environment: url`.
- Teardown on `closed`: `sprout ci teardown` (idempotent — exit 0 if
  already gone).
- Reset is an ordinary action: run `sprout ci reset` from a hand-rolled job
  or laptop with the same secrets — no ticked box, no marker token.
- Per-PR serial runs via a `sprout-preview-<PR>` concurrency group.

The caller must grant `contents: read` (checkout), `pull-requests: write`
(PR comment), and `packages: write` (image push to `ghcr.io`) — a reusable
workflow cannot elevate permissions.

Secrets (repo settings):

| Secret | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SPROUT_URL` | yes | Gateway URL |
| `SPROUT_TOKEN` | yes | Deploy token scoped to the repo's canonical id |
| `SPROUT_APP_ENV` | no | App secrets as one dotenv blob (GitHub caps secrets at 48 KB) |
| `SPROUT_SEED_ENV` | no | Seed secrets, same shape |

No file-type variables on GitHub: the blobs above are written to
`$RUNNER_TEMP` and read automatically by the CLI. When 48 KB is not
enough, commit a repo-relative dotenv file and pass it via the
`app_env_file` / `seed_env_file` inputs instead of the secret — same
escape hatch as the GitLab `variables:` mapping, without the config-time
expansion trap (inputs are plain paths, never variable references).

Deliberate differences from the GitLab component: there is no `on_stop` /
`auto_stop_in` equivalent — teardown on `closed` plus the gateway sweep is
the safety net, so a long-open PR keeps its preview. Like remote GitLab
includes, the caller pins `sprout_version` explicitly to the tag in the
`uses:` ref (the workflow never derives a version — an empty input fails
fast); no adopter-side version/checksum variables remain. Canonical repo id
is derived from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` automatically.

### Manual install (laptops, hand-rolled jobs)

Pick the asset that matches the host libc (names are honest):

| Asset | Libc | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `sprout-linux-x64` | glibc | Debian/Ubuntu runners (GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-*`) |
| `sprout-linux-x64-musl` | musl | Alpine runners; install `libstdc++` |

```bash
TAG=v0.9.0

# glibc hosts
curl -fsSL -o /usr/local/bin/sprout \
  "https://github.com/simpros/sprout/releases/download/${TAG}/sprout-linux-x64"
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sprout
sprout --version                # must equal $TAG

# musl / Alpine (Bun 1.4.x embeds still need libstdc++ at runtime)
# apk add --no-cache libstdc++   # once on the image
curl -fsSL -o /usr/local/bin/sprout \
  "https://github.com/simpros/sprout/releases/download/${TAG}/sprout-linux-x64-musl"
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sprout
sprout --version
```

CLI environment for hand-rolled jobs (the reusable workflow sets this
itself):

```yaml
env:
  SPROUT_URL: ${{ secrets.SPROUT_URL }}
  SPROUT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SPROUT_TOKEN }}
```

## Reset a preview

Wipe the preview database and redeploy + seed from scratch with one
command:

```bash
sprout ci reset
```

It tears down this MR's preview (containers + database + any
`preview.volumes` data volumes), then deploys again with the already
pushed images for the commit — no rebuild — re-running migrations and the
seed behind the health gate, then printing `preview_url=` like
`sprout ci preview`. The MR/PR note gains a `Reset: <actor> at <utc>`
line; the note is never duplicated.

Wipe vs re-seed: `sprout ci reset` wipes the database and redeploys from
scratch (data wiped), while `--reseed` / `sprout ci reseed -s …` re-runs
the seed against the existing database (data kept).

If the reset leaves the preview unhealthy, pull container logs through the
gateway (`sprout ci logs [--tail N]`, same output as `sprout logs`) and fix
forward — app crash-loop (migrations, missing env, wrong port) is the usual
cause; a failed seed keeps the app up and routable with `seeded_at` unset
(see [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)).

### GitLab triggering

GitLab has no "description edited → run a pipeline" trigger, so a reset is
always the manual path: press **Run** on the `sprout-reset` job inside the
existing MR pipeline — same `sprout ci reset`, same inputs as
`sprout-preview`, no new commit.

A fresh "Run pipeline" from the GitLab UI cannot be used for the instant
path: it arrives as `CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE=web`, which `sprout ci` refuses by
design (only merge-request pipelines deploy), so the instant path has to be
a job *inside* the existing MR pipeline.

### GitHub triggering

The caller workflow listens to `pull_request: types: [opened, synchronize,
reopened, closed]`. There is no `edited` trigger and no PR-body parsing:
every run deploys normally, and a reset is `sprout ci reset` from a
hand-rolled job or laptop with the same secrets.

## Migration from a hand-rolled script

Replace a hand-rolled `.gitlab-ci.yml` job (manual CLI install,
build/push, `sprout deploy` by hand) with the component. Concretely,
delete:

1. The `curl` install block (version pin, asset selection, `chmod`,
   `libstdc++` handling) — the component installs the pinned,
   checksum-verified binary matching the component version. This retires
   the custom installer and the `SPROUT_VERSION` / `SPROUT_SHA256` project
   variables: the version is now the component version (`sprout_version`
   input, pinned automatically on component includes).
2. The `docker build` / `docker push` steps and registry-login script —
   the component owns the dind service and login; `sprout ci preview`
   builds and pushes the app image and, when `.sprout.yaml` configures
   `seed`, the seed image. This retires `scripts/ci/sprout-preview.sh` and
   the seed-image script (image coordinates move into `.sprout.yaml`
   `build` / `seed` blocks).
3. The `sprout deploy -i … -s …` invocation, `preview_url=` scraping,
   dotenv writing, and `sprout teardown` script — the component calls
   `sprout ci preview` / `sprout ci teardown`, writes the dotenv artifact,
   and posts the MR note. Flag-by-flag `--app-env` assembly in shell goes
   away with it: extra env moves into `.sprout.yaml` (`preview.app_env` /
   `seed.env`), the `SPROUT_APP_ENV` / `SPROUT_SEED_ENV` file-type
   variables, or the `app_env_file` / `seed_env_file` component inputs.
4. Any reconstruction of the preview hostname in CI (string munging
   `pr-<id>.host`) — read `PREVIEW_URL` / `preview_url=` from the CLI
   output instead.

After the migration no adopter shell script remains: the component declares
all three jobs (`sprout-preview`, `sprout-stop-preview`, `sprout-reset`),
and every behavior the old script hand-built (install, build/push, deploy,
dotenv, MR note, log dump on failure) is owned by `sprout ci preview` /
`sprout ci teardown`. The `.sprout.yaml` `seed:` block replaces the `-s`
plumbing: when present, the CLI builds + pushes the seed image and deploys
with it; the hand-written `-s` flag disappears from CI entirely.
